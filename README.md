# Go Fish Yourself

## Overview
The goal of this project was to create an online multiplayer card game similar to the children's game Go Fish. The game uses a lobby system that automatically pairs users in groups of two as they connect. When two users connect to a lobby, the game draws 5 cards for each player. Then, each player takes turns clicking a card in their hand, and the game looks in the opponent's hand for a matching card value. If a match is found, the game removes the matched cards from the players' hands and awards a point, if no match is found, the game draws a card for the player that asked for a match.
